Designer --- Masaru Fujimaki 
I designed our home page and three webpages according to CRAP principle. 
I used Z pattern for the home page to adds readability. I used F pattern for three individual's pages because I think that webpage with more words is easier to read with F-pattern.
I used simple red-based color for background to emphasize the chinese culture. I used two fonts that are easy to read and match the content of webpages.
