# Assignment03-TOKYO 


## Designer --- Masaru Fujimaki 
I designed our home page and three webpages according to CRAP principle. 
I used Z pattern for the home page to adds readability. I used F pattern for three individual's pages because I think that webpage with more words is easier to read with F-pattern.
I used simple red-based color for background to emphasize the chinese culture. I used two fonts that are easy to read and match the content of webpages. 

## Coder --- Xuanyang (Valerie) Wang
I implemented the slideshow JS plugin on home page after IA had prepared the main content. 
I implemented the JS menu-highlighter to indicate the current page so that the user will be able to know which page they currently at. 
I also set up php includes files for links and script to factor out the common elements in each webpage, including navigation, head links, scripts and footers.
I uploaded the assignment to class web server and validated both HTML and CSS.
