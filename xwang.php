	<h2>About</h2>

  <p>Hi! My name is Valerie (Xuanyang) Wang. I am double majoring in computer science and business with a cluster in studio arts, and I am from class of 2020. My strength lies in digital photography, graphic design and marketing. I have programming experiences with Java and HTML. I am capable of providing innovative designs and solutions.</p>
  
  <h2>Experience</h2>

  <p>Long exposed to media and art atmosphere, I have made up my mind to integrate media and art as my future career. I used to work as a student intern at Pudong TV Station in Shanghai, China. Initially, I had researched on a drama director named Ma Yuan. I designed interview questions based on the result of my research and successfully conducted the interview. During the internship, I learned techniques such as subtitling, editing and proofreading TV programs. I also participated in program recording and basic post-production. In addition to the internship, I am currently working as Vice President and Staff Photographer of UR Photography, a student organization at the University of Rochester. Basically, my job is to take photos for on-campus events and activities, conduct professional headshots and satisfy clientsâ€™ requests for retouching and color-editing with Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom. I also organize and plan for regular club activities and keep an accurate list of organization members.</p>
